Hi, I'm Al Araf!  
**Java Backend Engineer | Spring Ecosystem Design | AI x ERP Systems Thinker**

I build production-grade Java/Spring backends and layer them with intelligent behavioral systems. From ERP microservices to persona-based engines, I engineer scalable, AI-augmented software for the modern stack.

## 🚀 Core Projects

### PIE: Personality Insight Engine  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Repo-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/alaraf-474/pie-personality-engine.git)  
A Spring Boot-based intelligence API that delivers lifestyle personas based on user psychology, income, and digital behavior.

- Clean architecture + secure RESTful API
- AI persona logic (Python bridge)
- React + Tailwind frontend in progress
- Graph DB integration and scoring engine planned

---

### Spring Security Deep-Dive  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_Repo-181717?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/alaraf-474/spring-security-demo)  
A zero-to-one exploration of authentication systems.

- JWT, RBAC, CORS, Keycloak OAuth2 flows
- API token protection + audit logging
- Swagger docs and modular codebase

---

### ERP Microservices Lab *(WIP)*  
A modular ERP backend exploring AI augmentation in core business logic.

- Spring Boot microservices for HR, Inventory, Finance
- Fraud detection via Python ML
- Document verification via Ethereum smart contracts

```java
@PostMapping("/score/personality")
public PersonaResult generate(@RequestBody PersonaRequest req) {
    return aiService.inferPersona(req); // Python bridge
}

🧠 Systems Thinking in Fiction

Lillith — Narrative Systems Engineering (via Obsidian + Quartz)

I use fiction as a framework to simulate collapse, behavioral drift, and system design failure in a tri-star galaxy.

Redox: A post-civilization world to explore asymmetry, collapse theory, and AI aftermaths.

Behavioral Models: Lillith's archetypes and factions inform logic in engines like PersonaX.

Documentation-First: Obsidian vault versioned with Quartz + GitHub Pages. Fiction treated like technical specs.


> I prototype systems through story mechanics before I build them in code.

PersonaX AI: Behavior-Driven Intelligence Engine


Backend AI engine translating behavioral inputs into monetizable personas.

Modular Spring Boot core with AI-driven scoring

Persona logic mapped via psychological attributes

Built for product personalization and lifestyle analytics

Future roadmap: Graph-based reasoning, streaming pipelines, enterprise APIs


@PostMapping("/persona/generate")
public PersonaResponse generatePersona(@RequestBody BehaviorData data) {
    return personaEngine.analyze(data); // Behavior mapping logic
}

📚 Currently Grinding

DSA with Java — Hackrrank (Optional)

Clean Architecture — aligning backend design to scale and maintainability

PersonaX — extending behavioral logic + real-time analysis

Quartz Publishing — systematizing Lillith documentation pipeline
